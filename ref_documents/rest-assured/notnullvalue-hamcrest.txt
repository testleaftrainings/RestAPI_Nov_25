notnullvalue hamcrest

The Hamcrest matcher for checking that a value is not null is notNullValue(). It is part of the org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers or org.hamcrest.Matchers class, and is a shortcut for not(nullValue()). 

Usage Examples

You can use notNullValue() in a Hamcrest assertion like this: 

import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat;
import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.is;
import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.notNullValue;

// ... inside a test method
Object myObject = new Object();
assertThat(myObject, is(notNullValue()));

The is() matcher is optional and primarily used for readability, making the assertion read more like an English sentence: "assertThat myObject, is notNullValue". The following are all equivalent: 

. assertThat(myObject, is(notNullValue()));
. assertThat(myObject, notNullValue());
. assertThat(myObject, is(not(nullValue())));

Type-Specific Matcher

There is also a generic version that accepts a class type to help with type inference in generic code, although it functions identically: 

assertThat(myObject, is(notNullValue(Object.class)));
