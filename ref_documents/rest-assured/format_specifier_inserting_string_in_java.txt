%s in java

In Java, %s is a format specifier used for inserting a string value into a formatted output. It's used with methods like System.out.printf() or String.format().

Usage and Purpose

The %s specifier acts as a placeholder that is replaced by the corresponding argument when the code is executed. It is part of Java's C-style formatting capabilities.

. %s: Formats the argument as a string, preserving the original casing.
. %S: Formats the argument as a string, converting all characters to uppercase. 

Common Formatting Methods

You can use %s in the following ways:

. System.out.printf(): Prints formatted output directly to the console.

String name = "Alice";
System.out.printf("Hello, %s!%n", name);
// Output: Hello, Alice!

. String.format(): Returns a new formatted string without printing it directly. This is useful for 
  creating strings to be used elsewhere in your program.

String name = "Bob";
String message = String.format("Welcome, %s.", name);
// message now contains "Welcome, Bob."

The %n specifier is used for a platform-independent newline character. 

Advanced Formatting Options

You can add modifiers between the % and s for more control over the output:

Specifier 	Purpose	                            Example	Output
%s	        Basic string	                    "%s"	"Text"
%S	        Uppercase	                        "%S"	"TEXT"
%10s	    Minimum width of 10, right-aligned	"%10s"	" Text"
%-10s	    Minimum width of 10, left-aligned   "%-10s"	"Text "

These specifiers, along with others like %d for integers and %f for floating-point numbers, allow for precise control over string presentation. You can find detailed documentation on Oracle's Java documentation website for all format specifiers.
