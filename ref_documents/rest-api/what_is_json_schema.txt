What is JSON Schema?

JSON Schema is a declarative language, written in JSON itself, that defines the structure, constraints, and data types for other JSON data. It acts as a blueprint or contract for JSON documents, providing a standard way to validate and document data. 

Key Purposes and Benefits:

1. Data Validation: The primary use of JSON Schema is to ensure that JSON data adheres to a predefined set of rules, preventing errors and inconsistencies before the data is processed by an application.

2. Documentation: A JSON Schema serves as clear, human-readable and machine-readable documentation, which improves collaboration among developers and stakeholders by defining expected data formats.

3. API Data Integrity: It is widely used in web APIs (like those using OpenAPI and AsyncAPI specifications) to validate request and response bodies, ensuring data consistency when exchanging information between different systems.

4. Code and Form Generation: Tools can use a JSON Schema to dynamically generate code, user interfaces, or input forms that conform to the specified structure and validation rules.

5. Interoperability: Because the schema itself is just a JSON document, it is language-agnostic and can be used across almost all programming languages, which promotes seamless data exchange

Core Concepts:

A JSON Schema uses specific keywords to define rules and annotations. 

--> type: Defines the expected data type (e.g., string, number, integer, object, array, boolean, null).

--> properties: For objects, this keyword specifies the allowed keys (properties) and the schema that each property's value must follow.

--> required: An array of strings that lists the property names that must be present in a JSON object for it to be considered valid.

--> title and description: These keywords provide metadata to annotate the schema for documentation purposes, without imposing validation constraints.

--> Constraints: Various keywords define constraints, such as minLength and maxLength for strings, minimum and maximum for numbers, and minItems and maxItems for arrays.
