how to move one folder to another folder in java

To move a folder in Java, the modern and recommended approach is to use the Files.move() method from the java.nio.file package. This method is efficient for moving empty directories and files. For non-empty directories, you must implement a recursive solution, typically using Files.walkFileTree

Moving an Empty Folder (and Files)

The Files.move() method can directly move a folder if the source folder is empty. It also works for moving individual files. 

import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.nio.file.StandardCopyOption;

public class FolderMover {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Path sourceFolderPath = Paths.get("/path/to/source/folder");
        // Ensure the destination path includes the source folder's name if you want to keep the name
        Path destinationFolderPath = Paths.get("/path/to/destination/parent/folder/folderName");

        try {
            // The REPLACE_EXISTING option will overwrite the target if it already exists
            Files.move(sourceFolderPath, destinationFolderPath, StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);
            System.out.println("Folder moved successfully!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Failed to move folder: " + e.getMessage());
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Moving a Non-Empty Folder Recursively

Moving a non-empty directory in Java requires you to first copy its contents (files and subdirectories) to the destination and then delete the original source directory. The Files.walkFileTree method is the standard way to implement this recursion.

Here is a conceptual approach using a utility class (you would need to adapt the copy logic to use Files.move on individual files and then delete the source directories):

1. Copy the directory tree: Use Files.walkFileTree with a custom FileVisitor to copy all files and
   create corresponding directories in the destination.
2. Delete the source directory tree: After a successful copy, use another Files.walkFileTree         
   operation to delete the source files and directories from the bottom up.

Since implementing this manually is complex, using a library like Apache Commons IO is often a simpler solution. The FileUtils.moveDirectory(srcDir, destDir) method provides a straightforward way to move entire directories. You can find more information in the Apache Commons IO documentation (https://commons.apache.org/io/).
